# Algorithm Design and Analysis
Implementation of some algorithms for my university assignment under Algorithm Design and Analysis subject

This repo can be divided into 2 parts where:
1. Assignment 1 included the implementation of Hash Table, AVL Binary Search Tree and Priority queue using Heap algorithms
2. Assignment 2 included the implementation ofm Display and Sort, Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms

For more info, please refer to the documentation pdf file in the reference folder
